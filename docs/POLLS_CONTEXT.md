## Data Structure

```typescript
interface PollOption {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  votes: number;
}

interface Poll {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  options: PollOption[];
  totalVotes: number;
  createdAt: string; // ISO date string
  createdBy: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  location: {
    name: string;
    coordinates?: [number, number]; // [longitude, latitude]
  };
  category?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  discussionChannelId?: string;
  metrics: {
    views: number;
    participationRate: number; // percentage of viewers who voted
    discussionCount: number; // number of messages in discussion channel
  };
  userVoted?: boolean; // if the current user has voted
  userVotedOption?: string; // id of the option the user voted for
}
```

## API Integration

### Endpoints to Implement
- `GET /api/polls` - Fetch polls with filters
  - Query params: 
    - `location`: string (location name or coordinates)
    - `sort`: 'latest' | 'trending' | 'most-discussed'
    - `search`: string (optional)
    - `page`: number (pagination)
    - `limit`: number (items per page)

- `GET /api/polls/:id` - Fetch single poll details

- `POST /api/polls/:id/vote` - Submit a vote
  - Body: `{ optionId: string }`

- `GET /api/polls/:id/discussion` - Get discussion channel for a poll

### Mock Data Structure
For development, use mock data that follows the Poll interface structure with realistic content for testing all UI states.

## State Management

### Local State
- Selected filter/sort option
- Search query
- Loading states

### Global State (Zustand)
- User location
- User voted polls
- Polls feed cache

## Features to Implement

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic polls feed with mock data
- Filter/sort functionality
- Search functionality
- Voting mechanism
- Basic results display

### Phase 2
- Location-based filtering
- API integration with backend
- Discussion channel integration
- Poll sharing functionality

### Phase 3
- Real-time poll updates
- Push notifications for trending polls
- Analytics for poll engagement
- User-created polls integration

## Integration Points
- **Location Services**: Integrate with device location
- **Discussion Channels**: Connect polls to discussion channels
- **User Authentication**: Track user votes and participation
- **Push Notifications**: Alert users about trending polls

## Accessibility Considerations
- Screen reader support for poll content
- Appropriate contrast for text readability
- Scalable text for users with visual impairments
- Alternative input methods for voting

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading poll cards
- Pagination for polls feed
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed polls
- Optimized progress bar rendering

## Testing Scenarios
- Test with different location settings
- Test filter/sort functionality
- Test voting mechanism
- Test discussion channel integration
- Test with various screen sizes

---

## Implementation Notes
- Use React Native Paper components for consistent UI
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Consider implementing a poll service layer for data fetching
- Use skeleton loaders for better UX during loading states
- Ensure voting mechanism has proper validation to prevent duplicate votes
