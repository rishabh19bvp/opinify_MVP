# ðŸ“° News Page - Technical Specification

## Overview
The News page provides hyper-local news content and updates to users based on their location. It serves as an information hub for community-related news, alerts, and updates.

## Purpose
- Deliver location-specific news content to users
- Keep citizens informed about local developments
- Provide a central source for community information

## User Flow
1. User navigates to the News tab from bottom navigation
2. Default view shows news articles filtered by user's current location
3. User can change location via location selector
4. User can filter news by categories
5. User can search for specific news content
6. User can pull to refresh for latest news
7. User can tap on news item to expand for full article
8. Optional: User can react to news items

## Data Structure

```typescript
interface NewsItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  preview: string;
  fullContent?: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  source: string;
  category: 'Local Alerts' | 'Municipal News' | 'Community Projects';
  timestamp: string; // ISO date string
  location: {
    name: string;
    coordinates?: [number, number]; // [longitude, latitude]
  };
  reactions?: {
    likes: number;
    shares: number;
  };
}
```

## API Integration

### Endpoints to Implement
- `GET /api/news` - Fetch news with filters
  - Query params: 
    - `location`: string (location name or coordinates)
    - `category`: string (optional)
    - `search`: string (optional)
    - `page`: number (pagination)
    - `limit`: number (items per page)

- `GET /api/news/:id` - Fetch single news item details

- `POST /api/news/:id/reaction` - Add reaction to news item
  - Body: `{ type: 'like' | 'share' | 'bookmark' }`

### Mock Data Structure
For development, use mock data that follows the NewsItem interface structure with realistic content for testing all UI states.

## State Management

### Local State
- Selected category
- Search query
- Loading states
- Expanded article state

### Global State (Zustand)
- User location
- Bookmarked/saved news items
- News feed cache

## Features to Implement

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic news feed with mock data
- Category filtering
- Search functionality
- Pull to refresh
- Basic article view

### Phase 2
- Location-based filtering
- API integration with real news sources
- Caching mechanism for offline access
- Improved article view with rich text

### Phase 3
- User reactions (likes, shares)
- Bookmarking functionality
- Push notifications for important news
- Analytics for popular news items

## Integration Points
- **Location Services**: Integrate with device location for local news
- **News API**: Connect to local news sources or aggregators
- **Push Notifications**: Alert users about breaking news
- **Social Sharing**: Allow sharing news to social platforms

## Accessibility Considerations
- Screen reader support for news content
- Appropriate contrast for text readability
- Scalable text for users with visual impairments
- Alternative text for images

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading images
- Pagination for news feed
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed news
- Optimized image sizes for mobile devices

## Testing Scenarios
- Test with different location settings
- Test category filtering and search functionality
- Test pull-to-refresh and pagination
- Test article expansion and reaction features
- Test offline capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Use React Native Paper components for consistent UI
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Consider implementing a news service layer for data fetching
- Use skeleton loaders for better UX during loading states
